THINGS TO REMEMBER:
  ***Accumulation should occur ONLY when header is in output, otherwise flits only move when header moves
       Does not accumulte when header is stuck in input
  Msg len should be ~200 flits
  Msg distance should be less than 1/2 lenth/width (could also fix by using odd dimension?)
  Track total # of messages
    Must be stable; count messages over different time intervals and look for stability
  GOAL: measure latency for a fixed value of lambda
    LATER GOALS: if lambda suddenly changes, how does system react?
